### Useful resources

- [How to Build Accessible Cards](https://www.nomensa.com/blog/how-build-accessible-cards-block-links/) - This article helped me understand how to build accessible card components by avoiding common pitfalls like wrapping the entire card in a link, and instead, using a script to make the whole block clickable while ensuring descriptive link text. It also provided tips on reordering content for better semantics, optimizing images for performance, and ensuring visual affordance and calls-to-action are clear and effective.
- [Tabs Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/) - This article helped me understand the tabs pattern, including how to structure tab elements, tab lists, and tab panels, as well as how to implement keyboard interactions and WAI-ARIA roles for accessible navigation.
- [](https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/) - This article futher helped me understand how to create accessible interfaces and the importance of semantic HTML and thoughtful JavaScript implementation for enhancing user experience across various devices and assistive technologies.
